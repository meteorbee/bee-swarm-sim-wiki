# Basic Egg Shop

[[File:Egg Shop.png|thumb|308x308px|The Basic Egg Shop.]]
The '''Basic Egg Shop''' is a [[:Category:Shops|shop]] located next to the [[Sunflower Field]] and behind an [[Instant Converter]]. It sells {{Cost|Basic Egg}} for increasing amounts of [[honey]]. 

The cost begins at 1,000 honey and increases exponentially (see [[#Formula|Formula section]] below), eventually capping off at 10,000,000 honey for the 22nd egg and beyond.[[File:EggPrices2.png|right|430x430px|alt=|A chart for the eggs' price.]]

==Formula==
The cost of egg number N is calculated as follows:
 base = 1000
 cost = base
 i = 0
 while i < N-1 do
     cost = 1.5*cost + base/(i+1)
     i = i + 1
 end
This comes out roughly exponential, but there isn't a "nice neat numbers" exponential formula.
 Base = 1000
 t = Base
 i = 0
 NN = 21
 For [i=0; t= Base, i < NN, i++, t=1.5*t+Base/(i+1);{Print[Floor[t+0.5]]}]
This does not work for Term 22, as the price caps out at 10,000,000 honey.

==Trivia==  
*The Basic Egg Shop and stacking the [[Sticker#Stickers|Round Basic Bee sticker]] are the only ways to obtain a {{Cost|Basic Egg|4=0}}, other than the one given to the player at the start of the game.
